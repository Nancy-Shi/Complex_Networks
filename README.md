# Complex_Networks
The project aims at constructing a complex network model with three dynamical layers: information, behavior, disease. 
We start with network basics. 
We first define an adjacency list tool to store nodes and their neighbors. Then, we construct functions to compute important network features: degree distribution, degree correlation, path length, nth moment.
