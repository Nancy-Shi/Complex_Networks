# Complex_Networks
The project aims at constructing a complex network model with three dynamical layers: information, behavior, disease. 
This repo contains all draft code, basic versions, and raw outputs related to the complex network project in Brazil. 
We start with network basics. 
We first define an adjacency list tool to store nodes and their neighbors. Then, we construct functions to compute important network features: degree distribution, degree correlation, path length, nth moment.
